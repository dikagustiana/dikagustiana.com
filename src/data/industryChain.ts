/**
 * The industry chain — content layer.
 *
 * One chain, read at two distances. Step back and it is an economy; step in
 * and it is a single unit of goods whose price is sliced at every joint. This
 * file holds WHAT is on the map — its anatomy, and, under a shift, the
 * owner's reading of its CONDITION: where each marked element stands, what
 * holds it, which of the three levers moves it, and who finances that.
 *
 * WHERE things sit is the generator's job
 * (scripts/build-chain-plate.mjs) for the two wide-screen plates, and the
 * column's job (src/components/industry-chain/ChainColumn.tsx) for a narrow
 * screen. Both read this file and nothing else; the overview on the landing
 * page is the same records at a coarser grouping (OVERVIEW_GROUPS, at the
 * bottom), never a second copy of them.
 *
 * Three properties hold everywhere here:
 *   - Generic across sectors. Sectors appear only as examples of a function.
 *   - The unit of analysis is the FUNCTION, not the firm.
 *   - Descriptive, not normative. Nothing here says a link should exist, and
 *     nothing here claims a shape: a geological chain funnels, a biological
 *     chain fragments, and the map draws neither.
 *
 * And one rule with no exceptions: NO FIGURES. No percentages, no amounts,
 * no magnitudes, illustrative or otherwise. The map carries the anatomy of a
 * slice — what attaches at a joint, which way the cost moves, which line of
 * the financial statements carries it — never its size. Standard identifiers
 * belong in the audit sources, not among the public labels.
 *
 * Four categories, four forms, never mixed:
 *   transformation stage   changes the form of the goods; conversion margin
 *   intermediary node      takes title, transforms nothing; revenue gross; spread
 *   enabling layer         capacity, inputs or rules supporting the goods
 *   physical return        goods moving back up the chain
 * plus two non-physical flows, money and information, each running both ways.
 * Control is assessed for the specified good OR service. A service provider
 * can be principal for its own service without owning its customer's goods.
 * These functional categories are not a gross/net accounting decision tree.
 *
 * Two controls sit over the same map, and they compose:
 *   distance   ECONOMY or FINANCE. The map does not change; the unit of
 *              reading does. Every joint carries two readings, one for each
 *              distance, and the chip on the joint shows the one that is on.
 *   shift      none (the resting state), REINDUSTRIALISATION or GREEN
 *              TRANSITION. A shift is an overlay: it highlights the joints and
 *              layers it moves and adds arrows; it never redraws the chain.
 *              The two shifts are exclusive in this interface so their
 *              mechanisms can be examined separately, including tensions.
 *
 * The division of labour between them is strict: the SHIFT decides which
 * elements are marked, and the DISTANCE decides only what a mark then says.
 * Move the distance control and the marks stay exactly where they were.
 *
 * The condition layer is the reason the map exists. The resting map is
 * descriptive anatomy; a shift adds the owner's reading on top of it, and the
 * two are kept visibly apart: a mark, a status and a panel belong to the
 * reading, never to the anatomy. Every marked element carries a STATUS that is
 * read without a click — stuck, moving, or unpriced — told by form, not
 * colour, and four lines that are read on a click, in one voice at a time:
 * where it stands, what holds it, the lever and what it does here, and who
 * finances it. The four lines are the owner's to write; `UNWRITTEN` marks the
 * slots that are still empty and the panel simply omits them.
 *
 * Two more things live here because they are content, not layout:
 *   SLUGS      one permanent public address per element. Displayed numbers
 *              are a reading order and change with the overlay; a slug never
 *              does, so it is what an essay links to and what the URL holds.
 *   ESSAY_ASSOCIATIONS   the essays that read an element, each with the
 *              context the association was made in. Owner-filled.

 * ONE SET OF RECORDS, TWO LEVELS. The overview on the landing page is these
 * records at a coarser grouping, not a second model. V5 drew it as the detail
 * with two boxes grouped — eight function columns on a canvas that rendered
 * its labels at ten pixels on a laptop. V5.1 groups the columns into the five
 * groups below, so the canvas fits the figure at one pixel per unit and a
 * first-time reader meets five things before forty. The detail keeps every
 * function under its own box; both plates draw the same five frames, so a
 * reader moving between them finds the same structure with its members
 * un-grouped.
 *
 * WHAT SURVIVES THE GROUPING, checked rather than assumed: every stage, every
 * enabling layer with its switch, every border, every non-physical flow,
 * every return with its own destination, every element either shift marks,
 * and every joint that crosses a group's edge. Only one group is collapsed
 * into a single box — distribution, wholesale and retail — and the two joints
 * inside it are drawn when the detail is shown. So the distance control has
 * chips to re-word and both overlays have marks to raise at the overview,
 * without expanding anything.
 *
 * GROUPING MUST NOT CHANGE MEANING. Four traps, each guarded by a test:
 *   - aggregation feeds from BIOLOGICAL only; extraction reaches processing
 *     directly, and a grouped drawing must not imply otherwise;
 *   - packaging is a PARALLEL INPUT to manufacturing, never a stage after it;
 *   - recovery does not send everything back to one place — which is why the
 *     returns are NOT grouped (see RETURNS_UNGROUPED below);
 *   - putting several functions in one box does not make their margins
